<h3>This is a very basic project including some recipes from the Internet.</h3>

<br>
<p>Things I was able to understand better thanks to working on this project are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to create new repository and push my project along with changes into Git and then GitHub platform</li>
    <li>How to create more than basic README.md file</li>
    <li>How to use basics of HTML</li>
    <li>I also learned that I need to teach myself VS Code shortcuts as soon as possible because wrapping multiple lines of text in million li tags was a nightmare haha</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very basic project including some recipes from the Internet.</p>

<p>I know it is not much but it's honest work.</p>
<p>Things I was able to understand better thanks to working on this project are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to create new repository and push my project with changes into Git and then GitHub platform</li>
    <li>How to use HTML</li>
</ul>
